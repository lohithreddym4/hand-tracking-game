# Gesture-based game Controller

## Introduction
This project allows you to control the arrow keys using hand gestures. Inspired by a YouTube short, I decided to build this from scratch to try it out myself. The gameplay is simple: use hand gestures to control the movement of the car.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
3. Install the required libraries by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Run `game.py` as an administrator to start the game.

## Usage
- Make sure your webcam is connected and positioned properly to capture your hand gestures.
- Run `game.py` as an administrator.
- Follow the on-screen instructions to calibrate the hand gestures.
- Once calibrated, use the following gestures to control the car:
  - Index finger up: Move forward
  - Middle finger to the right: Turn right
  - Thumb to the left: Turn left
  - Pinky backward: Move backward
  - Ring finger: Press enter (for actions like starting the game or pausing)

## Files
- `game.py`: The main Python script for the game.
- `handtrackingmodule.py`: Python script containing functions for hand tracking.
